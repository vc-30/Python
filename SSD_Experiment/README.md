#### Computing the min-max sizes and visualizing SSD Prior Boxes
If you have started working with Single Shot Detectors (a.k.a SSD) and have gone through its paper, there are several interesting details which is useful in utilizing SSD efficiently on custom dataset. One of the detail is in understanding the generation of prior boxes.

There are several tutorials/blogs online, which explains it quite well. However, if you are like me and want to try getting your hands dirty in understanding it further, than the attached scripts might help you.

**min_size.py:** It is the file which can be used in calculating the min and max sizes which is utilized by the original author of [SSD](https://github.com/weiliu89/caffe/tree/ssd). One thing to note here is the formula given in paper and used in actual implementation have a gap, paper specifies it uses 0.2 to 0.9 as min and max scales, however in reality the starting ratios are 0.1 and 0.2 giving 30.0 and 60.0 as the first min and max sizes.

**draw_center_and_priorbox.py:** This file utilizes the min and max sizes generated by **min_size.py** to further compute the prior boxes. This file generates the center of the prior boxes on an input image (e.g Original.jpg) and further utilizes min-max sizes and aspect ratios to draw the Prior box over the input image. Please see below the Original.jpg and SSD_Priorbox_Visualization.png on which the centers are marked in red (might require to zoom in) and one of the center (at x=766,y=355) is taken as a reference to understand how the prior boxes covers the actual object.

##### Note: I have attempted to make the script useful for someone to experiment further, and in order to quickly prototype I haven't optimized it further. In case you feel, I have misunderstood the actual implementation, please feel free to share the correction, as I too am in the learning phase like others. Happy Coding :)
